# Manoj's Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio website designed as a part of the CA bootcamp course assignment (T1A2). Commenced on Saturday, 04/11/23, this is currently under development, and scheduled to be completed by Friday, 17/11/23. The assignment is due Sunday, 19/11/23.

## Components

### Header
The Header, which is the top part of the site, features only the profile picture of the owner, which also serves as the home button. Hence, it's a simple implementation using the following syntax:

```html
<header>
        <div class="profile-logo">
            <a href="./index.html">
            <img src="./images/Cyan Blue backdrop Manoj profile photo.png" alt="Manoj profile pic">
            </a>
        </div>
    </header>

```

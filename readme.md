# Manoj's Portfolio

This portfolio website was created as a part of the CA bootcamp course assignment (T1A2) in November 2023. As of writing this document, I've completed only 31 days of coding experience! Please consider this work as a beginners work.

### Tech stack
- HTML and CSS.

### LIVE site
- Check out the deployed site: [Manoj's Portfolio site](https://manojportfolioca.netlify.app)

### Layout summary

<ul>
    <li>4 main pages: Homepage, About, Blog & Contact.</li>
    <li>3 sub-pages: Skills, Work Experience & Portfolio, housed within the About page.</li>
    <li>The Blog section has a Blog homepage which features the post summary (title, date, image, excerpt & a Read More link). When the link is clicked, it features the full long form content</li>
    <li>The Contact page has a form (not-functional) with input fields</li>
    <li>The header features the Navigation bar and the homepage icon, while the footer features the social media links.</li>
</ul>

### Interesting Features

<ol>
    <li>Download Resume button</li>
    <li>The input fields on the Contact page changes background colour when you are in it</li>
    <li>Minimalist layout with 1 main colour (white canvas) and 2 colours (shades of blue and yellow highlights)</li>
</ol>

### Going Forward
I am hoping to upgrade this portfolio for professional use:
<ul>
    <li>Make the online form functional, perhaps using Zapier.</li>
    <li>Implement Captcha on the Contact page to eliminate bots.</li>
    <li>Redo the blog page to make it look more beautiful or integrate it with professional blog platforms.</li>
    <li>Make the Portfolio cards smaller, and perhaps have a video walk though for each one as well. </li>
    <li>Perhaps, use a different font style</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Everyone Should Code</h3>

                Absolutely, the world we live in today is intricately entwined with computers and the internet. From the youngest to the oldest among us, these technologies are seamlessly woven into our daily lives. Whether it's shopping online, consulting with doctors remotely, staying in touch with loved ones or strangers, or managing our finances, the absence of the internet for even a day is often viewed as a nightmare. Despite this pervasive reliance on technology, there's a noticeable shortage of proficient web designers worldwide.

                The world clamors for well-designed websites and functional applications, yet few individuals choose web designing or app development as their academic focus or career path. Many perceive these fields akin to mathematicsâ€”difficult to grasp, poorly taught, and lacking confidence in their ability to code effectively. This perspective needs to change. Coding should be integrated into a child's educational curriculum as a fundamental subject alongside sciences, mathematics, language, and social sciences.

                Imagine a scenario where coding is not a daunting challenge but a natural skill acquired early in life. Children are remarkable learners, absorbing information rapidly and without the apprehension that often hampers adults. Providing a robust 10-year foundation in coding before university education equips them with ample exposure to creativity and innovation. This early immersion in technology fosters a generation more comfortable and adept in leveraging its potential.
                
                To achieve this shift, it's imperative for parents, educators, businesses, and governments to collaborate on redesigning education models. Emphasizing a technology-centric approach in our educational frameworks will prepare future generations to embrace the opportunities and challenges of a digital world. By making coding an integral part of early education, we empower young minds to explore, create, and innovate before they step into the professional realm.
                
                In essence, the evolution of education towards a more technology-driven paradigm is crucial. By prioritizing coding education, we nurture a generation equipped not just for corporate roles but also for entrepreneurial endeavors. It's a collective responsibility to revamp our education system and pave the way for a tech-savvy generation capable of shaping a digitally progressive future.
